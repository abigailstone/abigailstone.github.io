# Hi, I'm Abigail.

I'm a Boston-based data analyst. I'm excited about computer vision, machine learning, geospatial data, and green technology.

When I'm not coding, I spend my time running, birding, and zooming around the city on my bicycle. I'm also a cellist in the all-volunteer [Cambridge Symphony Orchestra](https://www.cambridgesymphony.org/).
