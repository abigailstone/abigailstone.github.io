Optimal Big Day 
A &ldquo;Big Day&rdquo; for birders is a day in which one tries to find as many species of birds as possible. My friend Myles and I built this web app to determine an optimal set of eBird Hotspots to visit in a given county to maximize the number of species that you could reasonably expect to see in a day.
Champlain Ice 
I built a Google Earth Engine web app to explore ice coverage and historical ice-on and ice-off dates on Lake Champlain using Sentinel-1 C-band SAR imagery. Its original purpose was to help me determine locations with open water that would be ideal for winter birding. Full disclosure: the &ldquo;current conditions&rdquo; checkbox is useless in the summertime, but feel free to poke around if you are reading this between November and April!" />
