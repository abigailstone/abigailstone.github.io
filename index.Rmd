## Hello!

I'm a first year Electrical & Computer Engineering Ph.D. student at Tufts University, advised by Dr. Karen Panetta. I'm a Research Assistant in Dr. Panetta's Vision and Sensing Systems Laboratory. My main interests are in computer vision, image processing, and remote sensing.

<!-- I'm a recent (February 2021) Computer Science graduate of Middlebury College. My main interests are in computer vision, image processing, and remote sensing. -->

<!-- # Recent Activity -->

<!-- - For my senior thesis at Middlebury College, I studied speckle noise reduction methods for multitemporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image datasets. I developed an improved diffusion-based despeckling algorithm that leverages both temporal and spatial information to improve the quality of the denoised result, especially for small-scale features. -->

<!-- - I spent Summer 2020 working on remote sensing research at Middlebury with Professor Andrea Vaccari. Our goal was to classify pavement quality based on X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar amplitude data. We compared pavement data collected by vehicle with SAR data from the COSMO-SkyMed satellite. [[group github](https://github.com/Middsense)] -->

<!-- - For my senior  seminar capstone project in the Fall of 2019, I compared several machine learning methods for automatically classifying land cover (specifically wetland areas) based on LiDAR data and optical imagery. [[abstract & poster](701summary.html)] -->

<!-- - At the end of my semester abroad in the Spring of 2019, I worked as a research assistant at the Laboratoire d'Informatique et d'Automatique pour des Systèmes at l'Université de Poitiers, where I constructed a prototype network of IoT devices using the LoRaWAN protocol.  -->

<!-- I also thoroughly enjoy hiking and birding and enjoying beautiful Vermont. I have a handful of bird-related data science projects on my [Github](https://github.com/abigailstone/). -->
