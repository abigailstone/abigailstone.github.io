# Hello!

I'm a first-year Electrical & Computer Engineering Ph.D. student at Tufts University, advised by Dr. Karen Panetta. I'm a Research Assistant in Dr. Panetta's Vision and Sensing Systems Laboratory. My main interests are in computer vision, image processing, and remote sensing.

I received my B.A. in Computer Science from Middlebury College, where I worked with Professor Andrea Vaccari on algorithms for Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery.
