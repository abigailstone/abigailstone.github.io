# Hi, I'm Abigail.

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical & Computer Engineering at [Tufts University](https://engineering.tufts.edu/ece/), advised by Dr. Karen Panetta. I'm a Research Assistant in Dr. Panetta's Vision and Sensing Systems Laboratory. My main interests are in computer vision, machine learning, and remote sensing.

Before Tufts, I received my B.A. in Computer Science from [Middlebury College](https://www.middlebury.edu/college/), where I worked with Professor Andrea Vaccari on algorithms for Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery. 

When I'm not coding, I spend my time running, birding, and zooming around the city on my bicycle. I'm also a cellist in the all-volunteer [Cambridge Symphony Orchestra](https://www.cambridgesymphony.org/).
