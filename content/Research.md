# Research

Broadly, my research interests focus around new imaging technologies and computer vision algorithms that advance our understanding of the world around us: most importantly, computer vision technologies that help us create a more equitable society and help us to be better stewards of our planet.

Most recently, I've been working on depth perception problems from a few different angles (both literally and figuratively), as well as deep learning models for hyperspectral imagery.
