  <p>Hello!</p>
  <p>
    I'm a fourth-year Computer Science student at Middlebury College, Class of 2020.5.
    My main interests are in computer vision, image processing, and remote sensing.
  </p>

  <p>
    For my senior thesis, I'm studying despeckling methods for multitemporal Synthetic
    Aperture Radar (SAR) image datasets. I'm working on a diffusion-based despeckling algorithm that leverages
    temporal information (as well as spatial information) to improve the quality of the denoised result,
    especially for small-scale features.
  </p>

  <h3>Recent Activity</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      I spent Summer 2020 working on remote sensing research with Professor Andrea Vaccari.
      Our goal was to classify pavement quality based on X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar amplitude
      data. We compared pavement data collected by vehicle with SAR data from the COSMO-SkyMed satellite.

      For a recent data science project, I explored reports of very large flocks of birds in the
      eBird basic dataset with the
      goal of understanding trends in the way birders count, estimate, and report very large numbers.

      For my senior seminar capstone project, I compared several machine learning methods for
      automatically classifying land cover (specifically, wetland areas) based
      on LiDAR data and optical imagery.

      At the end of my semester abroad in Spring of 2019, I worked as a research assistant
      at Laboratoire d'Informatique et d'Automatique pour des Syst&egravemes at l'Universit&eacute de Poitiers,
      where I constructed a prototype network of IoT devices using the LoRaWAN protocol.

  <h3>Miscellanea</h3>
  <p>
    In my non-CS life, I'm a cellist in the
    <a href='http://www.middlebury.edu/academics/music/Ensembles/CollegeOrchestra'> Middlebury College Orchestra </a>,
    where I've had the pleasure of  serving on the "Musical Chairs" as Treasurer for 2019-2020 year and Fall 2020 semester.

  <p>
    I like to spend my free time hiking and birding and enjoying beautiful Vermont (and on rainy days,
    adding identifications to <a href='https://www.inaturalist.org/people/953891'>iNaturalist</a>)
